# **Infosys-Responsible-AI-Toolkit**
The Infosys Responsible AI toolkit provides a set of APIs to integrate safety, privacy, security, explainability, fairness, and hallucination detection into AI solutions, ensuring trustworthiness and transparency. We are hosting our below API-based guardrails on platforms like Azure OpenAI.

To install any of the Infosys Responsible AI Toolkit modules, Open respective repositories & follow the instruction given in the readme file.

#	Module Name	Functionalities	Repository name
1	ModerationLayer APIs 	Moderates Input and Output of LLMs	"responsible-ai-moderationlayer,
responsible-ai-moderationModel"
2	Explainability APIs	Get Explainability to LLM responses, Global and local explainability for Regression, Classification and Timeseries Models	"responsible-ai-llm-explain, 
responsible-ai-explainability,
responsible-ai-moderationLayer"
3	Fairness & Bias API	Check Fairness and detect Biases associated with LLM prompts and responses and also for traditional ML models	responsible-ai-fairness
4	Hallucination API	Detect and quantify Hallucination in LLM responses under RAG scenarios	responsible-ai-hallucination
5	Privacy API 	Detect and anonymize or encrypt or hilight PII information in prompts for LLMs or in its responses	responsible-ai-privacy
6	Security API	Different types of security attacks and defenses on tabular and image data, prompt injection and jailbreak checks	responsible-ai-security-API
7	Safety API	Detects and anonymize toxic and profane text associated with LLMs	responsible-ai-safety
