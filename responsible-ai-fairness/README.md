## Introduction
Responsible-ai-fairness offers solutions for Traditional AI and LLM's fairness and bias evaluations. For traditional classification problems, the training datasets and model's predictions can be analyzed and mitigated for Group Fairness. Individual Fairness analysis is also supported to get a comprehensive analysis. For Large Language Models, given text is evaluated for bias context and highlights the affected groups and bias types using GPT-4.

To install the Infoysys Responsible AI fairness module, below are the list of required softwares and instructions to be followed. 

## Requirements
1. Python 3.9 and above
2. pip
3. Mongo DB
4. VSCode
5. infosys_responsible_ai_fairness-1.1.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl file having code to calculate metrics scores for bias analysis using [aif360](https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Holistic AI](https://github.com/holistic-ai/holisticai), [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn). 
6. aicloudlibs-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl file having code for logging and exception handling 
7. BART-large-mnli is a variant of the BART model specifically fine-tuned for multi-label natural language inference (MNLI) tasks. It features 406 million parameters, a maximum token size of 1024, 24 transformer layers, and a hidden size of 1024.  
Steps to Download BART-large-mnli:
   1.	Identify the Model URL: Navigate to the BART model page on the Hugging Face Model Hub. For example, for facebook/bart-large, the URL is:
      https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli
   2.	Find the Model Files: On the model page, you can see the available model files:
      
       •	pytorch_model.bin (the model weights)
      	
       •	config.json (model configuration)
 
       •	tokenizer.json or other tokenizer file.

       •	tokenizer_config.json .

       •	vocab.json.

       •	merges.txt.

       •	model.safetensors


   
   3.	Download the Files: You can use curl or wget to download the files directly from the command line.
     	
       curl -L -o pytorch_model.bin https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin
 
       curl -L -o config.json https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/config.json
 
       curl -L -o tokenizer.json https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/tokenizer.json

       curl -L -o tokenizer_config.json https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json

       curl -L -o merges.txt https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/merges.txt

       curl -L -o model.safetensors https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/model.safetensors

       curl -L -o vocab.json https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large/resolve/main/vocab.json
   
   4. Create two folders in **responsible-ai-fairness/responsible-ai-fairness/models** with the name **Tokenizer and Models** and place model and tokenizers files in this folders. 

## Installation
1.	Clone the repository 
2.	Create a virtual environment using the command 
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
and activate it by going to
```bash
.venv\Script\activate
```
3.	Setup the DB
      1. Create two collections in mongodb database by the name llm_connection_credentials and llm_analysis
      2. To insert the required documents into this, go to **responsible-ai-fairness\responsible-ai-fairness\docs\scripts** and import both the documents into  respective mongodb collection. llm_analysis json content is also given at the end of this file.
4.	Install dependencies. 
      1. Go to **responsible-ai-fairness\responsible-ai-fairness\requirements** and run 
      ```bash 
         pip install -r requirements.txt.
      ```
      2. if you are on windows, please add **../** in front to .whl files in requirements.txt to install without any errors.
5. Add required configurations provided below in .env file.
6. Run the application using below steps:
      1. Go to responsible-ai-fairness/responsible-ai-fairness/src 
      2. Run python main_api.py 
7. PORT_NO : Use the Port No that is configured in `.env` file.
   Open Swagger URL in browser once server is running: `http://localhost:<PORT_NO>/api/v1/fairness/docs#/`

## Configurations
 1. Add required environment variables.
 2. Below are the list of env one needs to add, to run the application, add required ones only. To run extra features, one needs to add corresponding config value.
 3. Add ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY in global environment variable of your account to run the server without any error. This ACCESS_KEY is for cloud storage, but if one dont have they can add it as "NA" for both the fields.

## Limitations
1. As of now analysing bias for classification models for traditional AI.
2. Data mitigation for preprocessing: 
   1. Reweighting can lead to overfitting on minority groups, potentially reducing overall model performance on the dataset.
   2. Adjusting weights can distort the original data distribution, leading to a loss of valuable information and potential misrepresentation of the data.
3. Currently mitigating bias for preprocessing dataset only.
4. Support for workbench related apis will be added in upcoming release.
5. Numpy version issue- For posttrain analysis, it required numpy version 1.26.4. So if one wants to use it, please install numpy 1.26.4.
6. For Preprocessing mitigate has log issues, intreseted users can add log and can use the features. This will be fixed in coming version.
7. For llm/analyze endpoint, default template is having some limitation, refer the Prompt template section below for advanced analysis. Update this template in database collection llm_analysis for the key **GPT_4O_TEXT**
8. For analysis/llm and analysis/image, currently we are supporting only model **gpt_4o_westus**, one can fix the issue by simply changing the model name in the service.py.

## Telemetry
1. Make tel_Falg as True.
. Follow the steps given in `responsible-ai-telemetry` to setup telemetry.
3. Pass the enpoint `/rai/v1/telemetry/errorloggingtelemetryapi` from above setup swagger ui to the varaible 'FAIRNESS_TELEMETRY_URL' in .env

## Roadmap
1. Small Language Model to evaluate text fairness. Finetuning Phi-3.5.
2. Multimodal based Image evaluation for fairness.
3. postprocessing data mitigation.
